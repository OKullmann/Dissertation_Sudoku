1) Bibliography

URGENTLY this needs to be extended, with at least 20 serious
references, and further popular literature references and web pages.


2) The three different spaces

This is a central concept of the book, and needs to be discussed and
defined.


3) Annotated Sudoku instances

The notion of "puzzle" is not useful for more detailed investigations.
Instead, as discussed "annotated Sudoku instances" need to be discussed.
Roles operate exactly on these annotated instances.
