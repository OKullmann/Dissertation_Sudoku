-------------------------------------------

1) Bibliography

URGENTLY this needs to be extended, with at least 20 serious
references, and further popular literature references and web pages.


2) The three different spaces

This is a central concept of the book, and needs to be discussed and
defined.


3) Annotated Sudoku instances

The notion of "puzzle" is not useful for more detailed investigations.
Instead, as discussed "annotated Sudoku instances" need to be discussed.
Roles operate exactly on these annotated instances.

Every cell consists of a partitioning of {1,...,9} into two
blocks, the "possible" numbers (the "candidates"), and the
"impossible" numbers ("excluced").
Thus a cell is precisely this:
  ({1,2.3},{4,5,6,7,8,9})
(first possible, then excluded).
The annotated instance is in 9x9 matrix, every entry of this matrix
is such a partitioning.

A rule just moves certain numbers from "possible" to "excluded".


4) All references to figures must use labels!
Find out how to define labels, and use them (a lot!).


5) Precise information on examples needed

Obviously, the concerned cells etc. in examples must be precisely stated
in the caption! Additionally, one could also boldface them.
However, no highlighting by colour (this is a usage-nightmare)!


6) Misuse of environment "description"

\begin{description}\end{description} is only to be used in case
a specific label is supplied for each entry. Otherwise use
"itemize" or "enumerate".
