2) The three or four different spaces

This is a central concept of the book, and needs to be discussed and
defined.

The annotated instance has the "rc-view" build-in.

Now the "rn-view" yields the same type of matrix,
a 9x9 matrix, where every entry is a partitioning of {1,...,9}
However the interpretation is different: For example if we call
the matrix M, which is the cn-view of the annotated instance A,
and we have $M_{1,1} = ({1,2,5},{3,4,6,7,8,9})$, then this means
that the possible columns for number 1 and row 1 are 1,2,5,
while the other columns have been excluded.
This is equivalent to that e.g. $A_{1,1}$ we have 1 included,
in $A_{1,2}$ we have 1 included, in $A_{1,3}$ we have 1 excluded, and so on.

A and M contain the same information, only viewed differently!
$RN_{1,1} = ({1,2,5},{3,4,6,7,8,9})$.

There should be a fully explained example, fully filled out, with
the three matrices.

There is now a fourth "dimension", the block-view:
Blocks are numbered 1-9 (top to bottom, left to right),
and the cells inside a block are also numbers 1-9.
So now r resp. c can be replaced by "b" (for block).
This yields a fourth view, the "bn" view.

So the example should have actually 4 matrices.

Regarding notations: perhaps "RN" instead of "M".
So we would have A=RC, RN, CN.
That is, we would have three matrices, and above we write

Inside the four views, what does it mean to speak of "rows" and "columns"?
Of "numbers"?? Of "boxes"???


3) Annotated Sudoku instances --Done

The notion of "puzzle" is not useful for more detailed investigations.
Instead, as discussed "annotated Sudoku instances" need to be discussed.
Roles operate exactly on these annotated instances.

Every cell consists of a partitioning of {1,...,9} into two
blocks, the "possible" numbers (the "candidates"), and the
"impossible" numbers ("excluced").
Thus a cell is precisely this:
  $({1,2.3},{4,5,6,7,8,9})$
(first possible, then excluded).
The annotated instance is in 9x9 matrix, every entry of this matrix
is such a partitioning.

A rule just moves certain numbers from "possible" to "excluded".


4) All references to figures must use labels!
Find out how to define labels, and use them (a lot!).


5) Precise information on examples needed --Done

Obviously, the concerned cells etc. in examples must be precisely stated
in the caption! Additionally, one could also boldface them.
However, no highlighting by colour (this is a usage-nightmare)!


6) Misuse of environment "description" --Done

{description} is only to be used in case
a specific label is supplied for each entry. Otherwise use
"itemize" or "enumerate".


7) Standardisation of all notions and notations! --Done


8) Formulation of the rules:

In general, a rule has as inputs certain annotated instances,
and as output a transformed annotated instance, where at least
one candidate became a non-candidate (and only such moves are
allowed (no backtracking), and every such move is correct).


9) Naked single

Exists in four forms.
Is just a "clean-up" rule.

Let's say a cell is "fixed", if only one candidate is left.
Now for a fixed cell, all the other cells in the row, column, and box
must have that number excluded.

Now it seems that this rule can be applied for all the four views!?
Here the above rule would take "cell", "row", "column", "number", "box"
just for the *matrix*, independent of the view.

The general question is about the "symmetry": Can we just formulate
the rules abstractly for annotated instances, as matrices, and then
apply these rules without modification of the four views?!?
Compare Chapter 1 in the book.
