Sudoku is a puzzle which is popularised into the world for ages. And there are amount of people spend times on either hard puzzle generated, or looking for the best techniques to improve the efficiency on solving difficult puzzle.
When the puzzle difficulty becomes harder and harder, then more advanced techniques will be required to be used together or in order to cope the puzzle. Surely, as the difficulties level goes up, the cost of time raise up even thought the suitable technique is given to help. Consequently, in this article, the first chapter is going to know the background of Sudoku and what is Sudoku, and the secondly understand discussed after understanding how these special techniques applied on eliminating impossibilities in puzzle solving. Afterwards, the efficiency of the special technique for solving Sudoku will be the final topic to discuss about in the end.
In this dissertation, the goal to achieve is to experience the time of applying special techniques on solving Sudoku puzzles. In addition, to find out the most efficient way to apply the combination of more than techniques and how many puzzles could it achieve to solve.


\section{What is Sudoku?}
\label{sec:whatissudoku}

Sudoku uses an $N \times N$ matrix, where $N = n \cdot n$, and for standard Sudoku we have $n = 3$, thus $N = 9$. Each entry (``cell'') contains a number in $\{1, \dots, N\}$, or it might be empty, that is, to be filled out. A completed Sudoku puzzle must fulfil the following additional requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In every row and in every column every number occurs only (exactly) once.
\item The same is true for the ``blocks'':
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The whole matrix is sub-divided into $N$ blocks.
  \item Each block is an $n \times n$ matrix.
  \end{enumerate}
  Now in each block every number has also to occur (exactly) once.
\end{enumerate}
For ``classical Sudoku'' puzzles we have the following additonal rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A Sudoku puzzle must have at least one solution (no unsolvable puzzles are normally considered).
\item And in fact, a Sudoku puzzle must have a unique solution (no multiple solutions are normally allowed).
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Techniques for solving Sudoku}
\label{sec:Techniques}
Sudoku problems have classified into different level according to its difficulties. To solve the puzzles, there are loads of techniques could be used to support user to solve Sudoku puzzles in different level of difficulties.
These techniques are usually divided into two main parts, one is called “Direct Elimination Technique”, and the other is named “Candidates Elimination Techniques".
Direct Elimination Technique is an approach could be easily applied without any pencilmarks written on. It eliminates the impossibilities through analysing the existing numbers given in the question step by step. It is the most common and easy way to cope the puzzles, but it will work insufficiently if the harder question has been encountered. 
Consequently, Candidates Elimination Techniques are provided to solve harder question. To apply this skill to deal Sudoku question, pencilmarks are mostly needed to be written in all the grids at the first stage. It is a step to write all the possibilities in all the awaiting grids. Pencilmarks will help with skills applied to eliminate all the impossibilities till the last unique digit is sure for players to fill the right digit in.
Generally, most of the Sudoku problem which is classified to easy level could be solved by applying naked single and hidden single skill if the Direct Elimination Technique is inapplicable. According to the Degree of difficulty, more and more Candidates Elimination Techniques will need to be applied jointly to figure out the solution. 
Naked single and hidden single are the basic methods of Candidates Elimination Techniques mostly used to start the game. When the harder puzzle comes, the techniques: naked pair, hidden pair, naked triplet, hidden triplet, naked quad or even hidden quad techniques will involves in solving the puzzle. Usually the general puzzles could be deal by the techniques introduced lately. X-wing, XY-wing, XYZ-wing, WXYZ-wing, and Swordfish are rare used only if the infrequent problem of high level difficulty appears.
